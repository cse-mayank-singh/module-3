//1.number is Strictly incrementing,decrementing, strictly incrementing then decrementing, strictly decrementing then incrementing
//2. To display first, middle, last element of the following: number, array, string, arrayList
//3. To check whether the given following are palindrome or not:1.Number 2Array 3. String 4.ArrayList
//5. given array[int] return true if the number 9 appears as either the first or last element in the array. length>=1;
//6. given str return a string of length 1 from its front, if the string is false then return 1  char from its back. the string will be of non empty
//7. We have 2 monkeys a and b and the params like asmile and bsmile indicates if each is smiling. we are in trouble return true if both smiling or if neither is smiling
//8. Tea and Candy in party, return the int outcome in the party encode as 0 for bad, 1 for good or 2 for great! 
//   good->  if both tea and candy is 5 
//   great-> either tea or candy is atleast double the amount of the other one then the party is great. However in all cases if either tea or candy is
//   bad->   less than 5 then the party is always bad
//9. arr[int] swap the first and last elements in the array the array length is atleast 1;
//10.Driving a little too fast and a police officer stops you. Write a code to compute the result encoded as an integer value. 
//   0-> no ticket 1-> small ticket 2-> big ticket. If the speed is 60 or less then the result is 0. 60<=speed<=80 then 1. else 2 unless you bday the speed 5 ka leave
//11.You have a green lottery ticket with int a,b,c; if the nums are all diff then the result is 0; if all same result is 20; if two are same then res is 10.
//11.1 A blue lottery ticket with int a,b,c; this make three pairs, which we will call them as AB,BC,AC. Consider the sum of the numbers in each pair. If any pair sums to exactly 10 then the result is 10.
//   otherwise if the AB sum is exactly 10 + more than either BC or AC sums then the result is 5...otherwise the result is 0;
//12.Given an array of ints of even length, return a new array of length 2 containing the middle 2 elements from the original array.
//	 The original array will be of length 2 or more 
//13.Start with 2 int arrays named as a and b each of length 2. Consider the sum of the values in each array. Return the array of largest sum. In the event of a type(sum is same) then return array a
//14.a,b,c int ...one is small one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large
